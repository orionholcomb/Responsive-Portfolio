        <img id="myphoto" src="assets/images/meeeee.jpg" alt="Is Me">

        <p id="paragraph1">My name is Orion Holcomb, and I was born in Lansing, Michigan where I didn't do very much
            before moving away from my homeland. At about 6 years
            old, me and my family moved out to Los Angeles, California and I pretty much grew up all my life around
            there. In the southern parts of Cali
            there happened to be an abundance of mexican immigrants, so I grew up eating conchas for breakfast and
            tamales for dinner. Over the years I
            began to develop a rather large imagination and I grew up writing stories and creating entire worlds inside
            my head and on paper. By the
            time I graduated middle school, we moved again.</p>

        <p id="paragraph2">In 9th grade I moved to Georgia, where I grew to love gaming! Every single day I would get
            home, drop my bags, and play games until I passed out.
            This made it very hard for me to socialize and complete important work, which really did a number on my
            relationship with my mother as well.
            I learned to manage my time and to be able to communicate with others, as this was a huge challenge for me
            in the 10th grade. One day,
            something clicked.<p>

                <p id="paragraph3">In the summer of 10th and 11th grade, I began to grow as a person more than I ever
                    had before. I had to deal with summer school and it made me
                    realize that I'm not invulnerable to inevitable progress and that it's time to become ready for my
                    future life post-graduation. I started
                    looking for colleges, but I couldn't find anything that stood out for me. After searching long and
                    hard I thought about pursuing the one
                    thing I love the most. What if instead of wasting my time gaming, I could make it my career? So I
                    decided to pursue it, and nobody could
                    stop me. Here I stand with my portfolio, which continues to grow each day as I complete new
                    assignments and personal projects. The future
                    is what I make of it.</p>
